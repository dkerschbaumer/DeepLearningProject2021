# Deep Learning Project 2021

In the project there is a main.py file to be executed and then the best model with the distorted dataset will be executed.

You can also decide what kind of distortion dataset you want to have by executing the "distortion_generator.py" file.

In the autoencoder.py file you can see how we implemented our autoencoder of what kind of layers our model consists.
